**"Phate" as "PHP http application thin engine"**

Phate is MVC application framework written by PHP.  
And I recommend using Facade pattern design.  
it's very simple, so faster than other perfect frameworks.  
Add any library if you want.  
  
If you consider your team, they will be brought nice breeze to your team.  
Free coding will make you free mind.  
Enjoy engineering!
